## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
if (!file.exists("activity.csv")) {
  unzip("activity.zip")  
}
data = read.csv("activity.csv")
complete = data[complete.cases(data),]
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
steps_per_day = aggregate(complete$steps, by=list(Date=complete$date), FUN=sum)
head(steps_per_day)

# Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(steps_per_day$x, xlab="Total steps", main="Histogram: Total number of steps per day")

# Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
print(c(mean(steps_per_day$x), median(steps_per_day$x)))
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis)
# and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
interval_averages = aggregate(complete$steps, by=list(interval=complete$interval), FUN=mean)
head(interval_averages)

plot(interval_averages$interval, interval_averages$x, type="l", xlab="Interval", ylab="steps")

# Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset,
# contains the maximum number of steps?
interval_averages[which(interval_averages$x == max(interval_averages$x)),"interval"]
```


## Imputing missing values

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e.
# the total number of rows with NAs)
sum(is.na(data$steps))

# Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset.
# The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use
# the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

# Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the
# missing data filled in.

# Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate
# and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.

# Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the
# assignment?

# What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total
# daily number of steps?
```


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
