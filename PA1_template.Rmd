## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
if (!file.exists("activity.csv")) {
  unzip("activity.zip")  
}
data = read.csv("activity.csv")
complete = data[complete.cases(data),]
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
steps_per_day = aggregate(complete$steps, by=list(Date=complete$date), FUN=sum)
head(steps_per_day)

# Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(steps_per_day$x, xlab="Total steps", main="Histogram: Total number of steps per day")

# Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
print(c(mean(steps_per_day$x), median(steps_per_day$x)))
```
